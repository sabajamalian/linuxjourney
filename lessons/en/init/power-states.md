## Lesson Content

Properly managing your Linux system's power state is a fundamental skill. While you can use a graphical interface, the command line provides powerful and flexible options for shutting down or restarting your machine. These processes are tied to the system's initialization system, such as `init` or `systemd`, which manages different operational states, including startup and shutdown.

### Shutting Down the System

The primary command for managing power states is `shutdown`. To power off your Linux system immediately, you can use the `shutdown` command with the `-h` (halt) flag and the time argument `now`. Administrative privileges are required, so you'll need to use `sudo`.

```bash
sudo shutdown -h now
```

The `-h` flag instructs the system to halt after shutting down services. On most modern hardware, this will fully power off the machine. You can also schedule a shutdown for a future time. To power off the system in a specific number of minutes, use the `+m` format:

```bash
sudo shutdown -h +2
```

This command will shut down your system in two minutes, which is useful for giving other users a warning or allowing background processes to finish gracefully.

### Restarting the System

To restart your Linux system, you can use the `shutdown` command with the `-r` (reboot) flag.

```bash
sudo shutdown -r now
```

A more direct and commonly used alternative is the `reboot` command, which achieves the same goal of safely restarting the system.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### Alternative Power Commands

For more direct control, you might also encounter the `halt` and `poweroff` commands. In many modern Linux distributions, these are essentially shortcuts that call the `shutdown` command. For example, running `poweroff` is often equivalent to running `shutdown -h now`.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **Check init system**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ps -p 1
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

2. **List services**: Try this command
   ```bash
   systemctl list-units --type=service | head -15
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

3. **Check service status**: Try this command
   ```bash
   systemctl status ssh` (if available)
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

4. **View runlevel**: Try this command
   ```bash
   runlevel` or `who -r
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```
