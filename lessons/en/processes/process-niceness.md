## Lesson Content

When you run multiple applications on your computer, it seems like they are all running simultaneously. In reality, the CPU is rapidly switching between them, giving each process a small amount of processing time.

### How the CPU Manages Processes

Each process is allocated a small amount of CPU time called a "time slice". After its time slice, a process is paused, and the CPU moves to the next one. By default, the Linux kernel schedules processes in a round-robin fashion, ensuring every process gets a fair share of CPU time until it completes. The kernel's scheduler is highly efficient at managing these rapid switches.

### What is Niceness in Linux

While processes cannot directly control their CPU time, you can influence the kernel's scheduling decisions. This is done by adjusting the **linux niceness** value of a process. The term "niceness" refers to how "nice" a process is to other processes on the system.

The **niceness of a process** is represented by a number ranging from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority).

- A high niceness value (e.g., 19) means the process is very "nice" and has a low priority, yielding CPU time to others.
- A low or negative niceness value (e.g., -20) means the process is not "nice" and demands more CPU time, giving it a higher priority.

Understanding **linux process niceness** is key to managing system resources effectively.

### Adjusting Process Priority

You can view the current niceness level of running processes using the `top` command. Look for the `NI` column, which displays the niceness value.

```bash
top
```

To control the **niceness linux** value, you can use the `nice` and `renice` commands.

Use the `nice` command to start a new process with a specific niceness level. For example, the following command starts `apt upgrade` with a niceness of 5.

```bash
nice -n 5 apt upgrade
```

To change the priority of an already running process, use the `renice` command. The following command changes the niceness of a process with PID 3245 to 10.

```bash
renice 10 -p 3245
```

## Exercise

Practice the commands in your Ubuntu VM terminal. Experiment with different options and variations to deepen your understanding.
