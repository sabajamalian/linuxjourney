## Lesson Content

When you inspect running processes, for example with the `ps aux` command, you'll notice a STAT column. Understanding the codes in this column is key to mastering process management. Each code represents a specific **linux process state**.

```bash
ps aux
```

A **process state in Linux** provides a snapshot of what a process is currently doing. Is it actively using the CPU, waiting for input, or has it terminated? Let's explore the most common states you will encounter.

### Decoding Common Process State Codes

The STAT column reveals the current **linux process state**. While there are many possible states, the following are the ones you will see most often. Having these **linux process states explained** will help you diagnose system behavior.

- **R (Running or Runnable)**: A process in this state is either actively executing on a CPU core or is in the run queue, ready to be executed as soon as a CPU core becomes available.

- **S (Interruptible Sleep)**: This is one of the most common **process states in Linux**. The process is waiting for an event to complete, such as user input from the terminal or a network packet to arrive. It is "interruptible," meaning it can be woken up by signals.

- **D (Uninterruptible Sleep)**: This process is also sleeping, but it's in a state where it cannot be interrupted by a signal. This is typically used for short periods during I/O operations where interrupting the process could lead to a corrupted state. If a process remains in this state for a long time, it may indicate a problem with hardware or a driver.

- **Z (Zombie)**: A zombie process has finished execution, but it still has an entry in the process table. It is waiting for its parent process to read its exit status. A few zombies are normal, but a large number may indicate a bug in the parent application.

- **T (Stopped)**: A process enters this state when it has been suspended by a job control signal (like pressing `Ctrl+Z`) or because it is being traced by a debugger. It can be resumed with the `SIGCONT` signal.

By understanding these fundamental **linux process states**, you can gain deeper insight into your system's activity and more effectively manage running applications.

## Exercise

Practice the commands in your Ubuntu VM terminal. Experiment with different options and variations to deepen your understanding.
