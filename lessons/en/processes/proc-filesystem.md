## Lesson Content

In Linux, a core principle is that everything is treated as a file. This concept extends to running processes, whose information is dynamically stored in a special virtual filesystem known as `/proc`.

### Exploring the /proc Directory

The `/proc` filesystem is not a real filesystem on your hard drive; it's created in memory by the kernel. It provides a window into the kernel's internal data structures and the state of the system.

To see its contents, you can list the files and directories within it:

```bash
ls /proc
```

You will see many numbered directories. Each number corresponds to the Process ID (PID) of a currently running process. You'll also find other files like `cpuinfo` and `meminfo` that provide system hardware information.

### Accessing Specific Process Information

If you identify a PID using a command like `ps`, you can find its corresponding directory in `/proc` to get more detailed information. For example, to inspect a process with PID 12345, you can look inside its status file:

```bash
cat /proc/12345/status
```

This command will display detailed information about the process, including its state (e.g., sleeping, running), memory usage, and user ID. The `/proc` directory offers the kernel's direct view of the process, providing far more data than standard tools.

### A Dashboard of System Data

Think of the `/proc` filesystem as the raw data source for many system monitoring tools. Utilities like `top`, `ps`, and `htop` read from `/proc` to present information in a user-friendly format. It contains a wealth of **extra** details that these tools might not show by default.

By directly accessing files within `/proc`, you can gather specific metrics to build custom scripts or a monitoring **dashboard** tailored to your needs. It's a powerful interface for observing and understanding the inner workings of your Linux system.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **Explore the /proc directory**: View process information filesystem
   ```bash
   ls /proc | head -20
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   1
   2
   3
   cpuinfo
   meminfo
   (PIDs and system info files)
   ```

2. **View process information**: Check info for current shell
   ```bash
   cat /proc/$$/status | head -15
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   Name:   bash
   State:  S (sleeping)
   Pid:    1234
   PPid:   1233
   ```

3. **Check system CPU information**: View processor details
   ```bash
   cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name" | head -1
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz
   ```

4. **View memory information**: Check system memory
   ```bash
   cat /proc/meminfo | head -10
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   MemTotal:        8052484 kB
   MemFree:         1234567 kB
   MemAvailable:    5678901 kB
   ```

5. **Check command line of a process**: View how process was started
   ```bash
   cat /proc/$$/cmdline
   echo
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   bash
   ```
