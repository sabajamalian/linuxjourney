## Lesson Content

A **linux network interface** is the crucial point of connection between the kernel's software networking stack and the physical network hardware. It allows your operating system to send and receive data over a network. We've already seen an example of what a configured `linux interface` looks like:

```plaintext
pete@icebox:~$ ifconfig -a
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 1d:3a:32:24:4d:ce
          inet addr:192.168.1.129  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fd60::21c:29ff:fe63:5cdc/64 Scope:Link
```

### Understanding Network Interfaces

When you view your network settings, you'll see interfaces with names like `eth0` (the first Ethernet card), `wlan0` (a wireless interface), or `lo` (the loopback interface). The loopback interface is a special virtual interface that represents your own computer, allowing you to connect to services running locally.

An interface can be in an "up" or "down" state. An "up" state means it's active and ready to transmit data, while "down" deactivates it. Key information displayed for each interface includes the `HWaddr` (its unique MAC address), `inet` address (its IPv4 address), and `inet6` address (its IPv6 address), along with the subnet mask and broadcast address.

### The Legacy ifconfig Command

The **ifconfig** command is a classic tool for configuring a `linux network interface`. On system boot, it typically runs to set up interfaces based on configuration files. While still available on many systems, it is now considered a legacy tool.

You can use `ifconfig` to manually assign an IP address and bring an interface up:

```bash
ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
```

You can also use the related `ifup` and `ifdown` commands to easily activate or deactivate an interface:

```bash
ifup eth0
ifdown eth0
```

### The Modern ip Command

The **ip** command is the modern and more powerful replacement for `ifconfig`. It is the preferred method for managing the network stack on most current Linux distributions.

Here are some common examples of its usage:

**Show information for all interfaces:**

```bash
ip link show
```

**Show detailed statistics for a specific interface:**

```bash
ip -s link show eth0
```

**Show IP addresses assigned to interfaces:**

```bash
ip address show
```

**Bring an interface up or down:**

```bash
ip link set eth0 up
ip link set eth0 down
```

**Add an IP address to an interface:**

```bash
ip address add 192.168.1.1/24 dev eth0
```

### Network Configuration Files

While commands like `ip` and `ifconfig` configure the live state of an interface, these changes are not permanent and will be lost on reboot. To make settings persistent, you must edit configuration files.

A common location for these files is `/etc/network/interfaces`. The `etc network interfaces` file is particularly prevalent on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu. Managing **debian network interfaces** through this file allows you to define static IP addresses, gateways, and other settings that are applied automatically at boot. The structure within `debian network/interfaces` is straightforward and well-documented.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **View IP configuration**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ip addr show
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

2. **Check network interfaces**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ls /sys/class/net/
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

3. **View ARP table**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ip neigh` or `arp -a
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

4. **Check network statistics**: Try this command
   ```bash
   netstat -i` or `ip -s link
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```
