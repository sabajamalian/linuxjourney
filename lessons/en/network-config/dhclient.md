## Lesson Content

We've discussed DHCP before, and most often you will never need to statically set your IP addresses, subnet masks, etc. Instead, you'll be using DHCP! The `dhclient` starts up on boot and gets a list of network interfaces from the `dhclient.conf` file. For each interface listed, it tries to configure the interface using the DHCP protocol.

In the `dhclient.leases` file, `dhclient` keeps track of a list of leases across system reboots. After reading `dhclient.conf`, the `dhclient.leases` file is read to let it know what leases it's already assigned.

### To obtain a fresh IP

```bash
sudo dhclient
```

## Exercise
