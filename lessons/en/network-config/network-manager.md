## Lesson Content

For a system's networking to be configured automatically, a service is typically already in place. Most modern Linux distributions utilize the NetworkManager daemon for this purpose, making it a cornerstone of **linux network management**.

### What is Network Manager in Linux?

If you are using a graphical user interface (GUI), you will likely notice the **Network Manager Linux** service as an applet on your desktop's taskbar. This tool manages your network hardware and connection information. For example, upon startup, NetworkManager gathers information about network hardware, searches for available connections (such as wireless or wired networks), and then activates them to get you online.

### Command-Line Interaction

While the GUI applet is convenient, there are also powerful command-line tools to interact with the **networkmanager linux** service. These are essential for server administration and scripting.

### Using nm-tool

The `nm-tool` command reports NetworkManager's current state and a list of its managed devices. Note that `nm-tool` is considered deprecated on many modern systems in favor of `nmcli`.

    Gateway:         192.168.22.2

    DNS:             192.168.22.2
```

### The Modern nmcli Tool

The `nmcli` command is the primary command-line utility for controlling and modifying the **Linux Network Manager**. It allows you to view status, manage connections, and configure network devices directly from the terminal. For a complete list of its capabilities, refer to its man page (`man nmcli`).

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **View IP configuration**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ip addr show
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

2. **Check network interfaces**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ls /sys/class/net/
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

3. **View ARP table**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ip neigh` or `arp -a
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

4. **Check network statistics**: Try this command
   ```bash
   netstat -i` or `ip -s link
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```
