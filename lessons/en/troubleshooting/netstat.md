### Well-Known Ports

We've discussed how data is transmitted through ports on our machine. Let's look at some common, well-known ports. You can find a list of these ports in the **/etc/services** file:

```plaintext
ftp             21/tcp
ssh             22/tcp
smtp            25/tcp
domain          53/tcp  # DNS
http            80/tcp
https           443/tcp
..etc..
```

The first column shows the service name, followed by its assigned port number and the transport layer protocol it uses.

### Introduction to linux netstat

An extremely useful tool for gathering detailed network information is **netstat**. The `linux netstat` command displays a wide range of network-related data, including active network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics. It is often called the Swiss Army knife of networking tools.

This lesson will focus on using `netstat` to check the status of network connections. Before we dive into an example, let's clarify the difference between sockets and ports. A **port** is a numerical identifier used to direct data to a specific application. A **socket** is an endpoint for communication, allowing programs to send and receive data. The socket address is the unique combination of an IP address and a port number. Every connection between a host and a destination requires a unique socket. For example, while the HTTP service runs on port 80, multiple HTTP connections can exist simultaneously, and a unique socket is created for each one.

Let's examine the output of `netstat -at`:

```bash
pete@icebox:~$ netstat -at
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
tcp        0      0 icebox:domain           *:*                     LISTEN
tcp        0      0 localhost:ipp           *:*                     LISTEN
tcp        0      0 icebox.lan:44468        124.28.28.50:http       TIME_WAIT
tcp        0      0 icebox.lan:34751        124.28.29.50:http       TIME_WAIT
tcp        0      0 icebox.lan:34604        economy.canonical.:http TIME_WAIT
tcp6       0      0 ip6-localhost:ipp       [::]:*                  LISTEN
tcp6       1      0 ip6-localhost:35094     ip6-localhost:ipp       CLOSE_WAIT
tcp6       0      0 ip6-localhost:ipp       ip6-localhost:35094     FIN_WAIT2
```

The `netstat -a` command displays all listening and non-listening sockets, while the `-t` flag filters the output to show only TCP connections.

The columns are as follows:

- **Proto**: The protocol used (e.g., TCP or UDP).
- **Recv-Q**: The queue of data waiting to be received.
- **Send-Q**: The queue of data waiting to be sent.
- **Local Address**: The address of the local host.
- **Foreign Address**: The address of the remote host.
- **State**: The current state of the socket.

### Understanding Connection States

The **State** column provides crucial information about the status of a connection. Here are a few common states you will encounter:

- **LISTENING**: The socket is waiting for incoming connections. For a TCP connection to be made, the destination must be listening.
- **SYN_SENT**: When using `netstat`, a `SYN_SENT` state indicates the socket is actively attempting to establish a connection.
- **ESTABLISHED**: The socket has a fully established connection.
- **CLOSE_WAIT**: The `netstat close_wait` state means the remote host has shut down, and the local system is waiting for the application to close the socket.
- **TIME_WAIT**: The socket is waiting after closing to handle any packets that might still be in the network.

You can see a full list of socket states in the `netstat` man page.
