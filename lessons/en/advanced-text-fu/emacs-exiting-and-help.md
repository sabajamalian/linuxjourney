## Lesson Content

### To close out of Emacs

```
C-x C-c
```

If you have any open buffers, it will ask you to save before closing out of Emacs.

### Confused?

```
C-h C-h : help menu
```

### Undo

```
C-x u
```

As you can see, Emacs has more moving parts, so the learning curve is a little steeper. In exchange, though, you get a very powerful text editor.

## Exercise

Practice the commands in your Ubuntu VM terminal. Experiment with different options and variations to deepen your understanding.
