## Lesson Content

Understanding the **basics of linux** networking is a fundamental skill. For many, grasping these concepts is the **best way to learn linux** more deeply, as networks are integral to how modern systems operate. Let's explore a typical home network to understand the core components.

### Core Network Components

Your home network is a small ecosystem of devices working together. Here are the key players:

- **ISP (Internet Service Provider):** This is the company you pay for your internet connection, linking your home to the global internet.
- **Router:** The router is the central hub of your network. It directs traffic, allowing each machine to connect to the internet and communicate with each other. Modern routers support both wired (Ethernet) and wireless connections.

### Understanding Network Types WAN LAN and WLAN

Networks are categorized by their scale. In a home setup, you'll encounter these three common types, which form the foundation of **basics network** knowledge:

- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** This term describes the vast network outside your home, connecting your router to the broader internet.
- **WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network):** This is your Wi-Fi network. It connects wireless devices, like laptops and smartphones, to your router without physical cables.
- **LAN (Local Area Network):** This refers to the wired part of your network, connecting devices like desktop PCs or game consoles to your router via an Ethernet cable.

### Hosts and Packets

On any network, every connected device—be it a computer, phone, or server—is known as a **host**.

All data transmitted across these networks, from web pages to emails, is broken down into small pieces called **packets**. Throughout the Networking Nomad section, you will learn in detail how these packets travel to and from different hosts, completing their journey across the internet.
