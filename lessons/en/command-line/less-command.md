## Lesson Content

When viewing text files that are too large to fit on a single screen, the `less command` is an invaluable tool. As the old Unix saying goes, "less is more." (This is a play on the fact that there is also a `more` command with similar functionality). The `less` utility displays text in a paged format, allowing you to navigate through a file page by page without loading the entire file into memory.

### Getting Started with the Less Command

To start viewing a file, simply use the `command less` followed by the filename. This will open the file in the `less` interface.

```bash
less /home/pete/Documents/text1
```

Once you are inside the `less` viewer, your standard shell commands won't work. Instead, you use a specific set of keys to navigate and interact with the text.

### Navigation and Controls

You can use several keys to move through the document:

- **Arrow Keys and Page Keys**: Use `Page Up`, `Page Down`, `Up`, and `Down` to navigate line by line or page by page.
- **Go to Start**: Press `g` to move directly to the beginning of the text file.
- **Go to End**: Press `G` (Shift + g) to jump to the end of the text file.
- **Help Menu**: If you forget the commands while inside `less`, just press `h` to display a helpful summary.

### Unix Less Search

A powerful feature of `less` is its ability to search for text. To perform a `unix less search`, type `/` followed by the text you want to find, and then press Enter. This will highlight all occurrences of your search term.

- `/search_term`: Searches forward for "search_term".
- `?search_term`: Searches backward for "search_term".
- `n`: Jumps to the next occurrence of the search term.
- `N`: Jumps to the previous occurrence.

### How to Exit Less

When you are finished viewing the file, you need to know how to `exit less` and return to your command prompt.

- **Quit**: Simply press `q` to quit the `less` viewer and go back to your shell.

Mastering the `less command` is a fundamental skill for anyone working on the Linux command line, making file inspection much more efficient.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **Open a file with less**: View a system file
   ```bash
   less /etc/services
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Opens file in pager - press 'q' to quit)
   ```

2. **Navigate through the file**: Practice movement commands
   - Press **Space** to move down one page
   - Press **b** to move back one page
   - Press **g** to go to the beginning
   - Press **G** to go to the end
   - Press **q** to quit

3. **Search within less**: Open a file and search
   ```bash
   less /etc/services
   ```
   Then type **/http** and press Enter to search for "http"

4. **View command output with less**: Pipe a long listing into less
   ```bash
   ls -lR /etc | less
   ```
