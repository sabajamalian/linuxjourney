## Lesson Content

When working on the Linux command line, you'll often need a quick reminder of how a command works or what options it accepts. Fortunately, Linux provides excellent tools for command line help right in the terminal.

### The 'help' Command for Bash Built-ins

One of the most direct tools is `help`, a command that is built directly into the Bash shell. It is specifically designed to provide information about other Bash built-in commands. A built-in command is part of the shell itself, not a separate program. Examples include `echo`, `cd`, and `pwd`.

To use the **Linux help command**, simply type `help` followed by the name of the built-in command.

```bash
help echo
```

This will display a summary of the `echo` command, its syntax, and a list of available options. This is the fastest way to get assistance for shell-specific functions.

### The --help Flag for Executable Programs

For most other executable programs that are not built into the shell, the `help` command won't work. Instead, a common convention is to provide a `--help` flag. This option signals the program to print a usage summary and then exit.

```bash
ls --help
```

While most developers adhere to this standard, it's not universal. However, trying the `--help` flag is usually the best first step to find help for an unfamiliar program. It's a fundamental skill for anyone learning about **Linux commands**.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **Get help for a built-in command**: Use help for cd
   ```bash
   help cd
   ```

2. **List all shell built-ins**: See what commands have help
   ```bash
   help | head -20
   ```

3. **Get help for another built-in**: Check help for alias
   ```bash
   help alias
   ```

4. **Get help for export**: Learn about the export command
   ```bash
   help export
   ```
