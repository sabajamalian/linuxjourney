## Lesson Content

As you work with files, you'll need to organize them into directories. The primary tool for this task is the `mkdir` command, which stands for "Make Directory". This command allows you to **create a directory in Linux** right from your terminal or **command prompt**.

### Creating a Single Directory

The most basic use of the **mkdir command in Linux** is to create a single new directory. If the directory doesn't already exist, this command will create it in your current location. For example, to create a directory named `documents`:

```bash
mkdir documents
```

### Creating Multiple Directories

You can also create several directories at once by listing their names, separated by spaces. This is an efficient way to set up multiple folders quickly.

```bash
mkdir books paintings
```

### Creating Nested Directories

Sometimes you need to create a directory and its parent directories simultaneously. The `-p` (parent) option is perfect for this. This powerful feature of the **create folder Linux command** prevents errors if parent directories don't exist. For instance, to create the directory `favorites` inside `hemmingway`, which is inside `books`:

```bash
mkdir -p books/hemmingway/favorites
```

This single command creates `books`, `hemmingway`, and `favorites` if they don't already exist, demonstrating a key capability when you need to **create a directory in Linux**.
