## Lesson Content

In the previous lesson, we learned about `touch`. Let's revisit that for a bit. Did you notice that the filename didn't conform to standard naming conventions, like you've probably seen with other operating systems such as Windows? Normally, you would expect a file called `banana.jpeg` to be a JPEG picture file.

In Linux, filenames aren't required to represent the contents of the file. You can create a file called `funny.gif` that isn't actually a GIF.

To find out what kind of file a file is, you can use the `file` command. It will show you a description of the file's contents.

```bash
file banana.jpg
```

## Exercise
