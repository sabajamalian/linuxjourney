## Lesson Content

### What is the Linux Shell

Welcome to your Linux journey! The first step is understanding the Linux shell. A shell is a powerful program that acts as an interface, accepting your typed commands and passing them to the operating system for execution. If you've used a graphical user interface (GUI), you might have encountered applications like "Terminal" or "Console." These are simply programs that open a Linux shell session for you. Throughout this course, we will explore the capabilities of the shell and the many Linux commands available.

### Interacting with the Bash Shell

For this course, we will focus on the Bash (Bourne Again Shell) program, which is the default Linux shell on most systems. When you open a terminal, you'll be greeted by the shell prompt. Its appearance can vary, but it often looks like this: `username@hostname:current_directory$`.

```plaintext
pete@icebox:/home/pete $
```

The `$` symbol indicates the shell is ready to accept your input. You do not type this symbol when entering commands; it is purely informational. While other shells like `ksh`, `zsh`, and `tcsh` exist, mastering Bash provides a solid foundation for using the linux commands shell on any system.

### Your First Linux Command

Let's start with one of the most basic Linux commands for beginners: `echo`. This command is straightforward—it simply displays, or "echoes," the text you provide as arguments back to the terminal. This is a fundamental example of how Linux commands work and a great start to your linux jurney.

```bash
echo Hello World
```
