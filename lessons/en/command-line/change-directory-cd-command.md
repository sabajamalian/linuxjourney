## Lesson Content

To move around the Linux filesystem, you'll use paths to specify your destination. The primary tool for this is the `cd` (change directory) command. Understanding how to use this `cd linux command` is a fundamental skill for working in the terminal or `cd command prompt`.

### Understanding Paths

There are two ways to specify a path: absolute and relative.

- **Absolute Path**: This is the full path starting from the root directory (`/`). The root is the top-level directory in the filesystem. Any path that begins with `/` is an absolute path. For example: `/home/pete/Desktop`.

- **Relative Path**: This path is relative to your current location in the filesystem. If you are in `/home/pete/Documents` and want to access a subdirectory named `taxes`, you don't need the full path. You can simply use the relative path: `taxes/`.

### Using the cd Command

Once you understand paths, you can use the `cd command` to change your current directory. Whether you're in a Linux terminal or a Windows `cd command cmd` prompt, the concept of changing directories is universal, though the syntax may differ slightly.

To change to a specific directory using an absolute path, you would type:

```bash
cd /home/pete/Pictures
```

This command moves you directly to the `Pictures` directory.

### Navigating to a cd folder

If you are already in a directory and want to move to a sub-directory, you can use a relative path. For instance, if your current location is `/home/pete/Pictures` and it contains a `cd folder` named `Hawaii`, you can navigate into it with:

```bash
cd Hawaii
```

Notice we only used the folder's name. This is because we were already in its parent directory, `/home/pete/Pictures`.

### Essential Navigation Shortcuts

Navigating with full paths can be tedious. Fortunately, the shell provides several shortcuts to make moving around much faster.

- `.` (current directory): Represents the directory you are currently in.
- `..` (parent directory): Moves you one level up to the directory containing your current one.
- `~` (home directory): A shortcut to your personal home directory, like `/home/pete`.
- `-` (previous directory): Takes you back to the last directory you were in.

You can use these shortcuts with the `cd command`:

```bash
cd .
cd ..
cd ~
cd -
```

Experiment with these shortcuts to become more efficient on the command line.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **Navigate to root directory**: Move to the top of the filesystem
   ```bash
   cd /
   pwd
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   /
   ```

2. **Use absolute path**: Navigate to /usr/share using the full path
   ```bash
   cd /usr/share
   pwd
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   /usr/share
   ```

3. **Use relative path**: Move up one directory level
   ```bash
   cd ..
   pwd
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   /usr
   ```

4. **Return to home directory**: Use cd without arguments
   ```bash
   cd
   pwd
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   /home/your-username
   ```

5. **Use cd with tilde**: Navigate to home using the ~ shortcut
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents
   pwd
   ```

## Quiz Question
