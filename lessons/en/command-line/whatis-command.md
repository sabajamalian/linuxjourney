## Lesson Content

As you explore the Linux command line, you'll encounter a vast number of commands. It's natural to forget what a specific command does. Fortunately, there's a simple utility to help you out.

### What is the whatis Command in Linux

The `whatis` command in Linux displays a concise, one-line description of a command directly from its manual (man) page. It's a quick way to get a reminder of a command's primary function without reading the entire man page. Think of the **linux whatis** command as a quick dictionary for your terminal.

### How to Use the whatis Command

Using the **whatis command linux** is straightforward. Simply type `whatis` followed by the name of the command you want to know about. For example, if you're unsure about the `cat` command, you can run:

```bash
whatis cat
```

This will return a short description, such as "cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output".

### Understanding the Output

The description provided by the **linux whatis command** is sourced directly from the NAME section of the command's manual page. This ensures the information is accurate and consistent with the system's documentation. If a command has multiple manual pages in different sections, `whatis` may display a line for each, helping you understand its various contexts.
