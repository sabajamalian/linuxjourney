## Lesson Content

While many enterprise environments rely on dedicated systems for identity management, understanding the fundamentals of **Linux user management** directly on a single machine is a crucial skill. Several utilities serve as **the command-line tool for managing accounts in Linux**, allowing for efficient administration from the terminal.

### Adding Users

To create a new user, you can use the `useradd` command. It is a low-level utility that creates a new user account based on default values found in `/etc/default/useradd`. While some systems also offer `adduser`, a more interactive and user-friendly script, `useradd` is the universal standard.

```bash
sudo useradd bob
```

Executing this command adds an entry for the user "bob" in the `/etc/passwd` file, sets up default group memberships, and creates a corresponding entry in the `/etc/shadow` file to store password information securely.

### Removing Users

To remove a user account, you can use the `userdel` command. This command effectively reverses the changes made by `useradd` by removing the user's entries from the system account files.

```bash
sudo userdel bob
```

By default, this command may not remove the user's home directory. You can use the `-r` flag (`userdel -r bob`) to ensure the home directory and mail spool are also deleted.

### Changing Passwords

The `passwd` command is used to set or change a user's password. A regular user can run this command to change their own password. The root user can run it to change any user's password.

```bash
passwd bob
```

When run by an administrator, the system will prompt for a new password for the specified user without asking for the old one. This is a fundamental task in **Linux user management**.

## Exercise
