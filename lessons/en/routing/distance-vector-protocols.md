## Lesson Content

Distance vector protocols are a fundamental category of routing protocols used in computer networks. They determine the best path for data packets based on distance, which is typically measured by **hop count**. In this type of **network routing**, each router maintains a table of the "distance" to all known networks.

### How Distance Vector Protocols Work

The core principle of a distance vector protocol is straightforward: routers share their routing information with their immediate neighbors. This process is sometimes called "routing by rumor." For example, if Router A knows it is 3 hops away from Network X, and Router B is a direct neighbor of Router A, Router B can infer that it is 4 hops away from Network X via Router A. When multiple paths to the same destination exist, the protocol will always choose the path with the lowest **hop count**.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Distance vector protocols** are simple to configure and work well in small, stable networks. However, they have significant limitations that make them less suitable for larger, more complex environments.

One major downside is slow convergence. Routers periodically broadcast their entire routing table to their neighbors, which can consume significant bandwidth and processing power, especially as the network grows. If a network change occurs, it can take a long time for that information to propagate to all routers.

Another key disadvantage is that the shortest path in terms of **hop count** is not always the most efficient. A path with fewer hops might have slower links (e.g., 10 Mbps) compared to a path with more hops that uses faster links (e.g., 1 Gbps). Distance vector protocols are generally unaware of link speed, leading to suboptimal routing decisions.

### RIP A Common Example

One of the most well-known **distance vector protocols** is the **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)**. It is a classic example that clearly demonstrates the principles and limitations of this protocol family.

- **Periodic Updates:** RIP broadcasts its entire routing table to all neighbors every 30 seconds.
- **Hop Count Limit:** To prevent routing loops and control network traffic, RIP enforces a maximum **hop count** of 15. Any route that requires 16 hops is considered unreachable.

Because of these characteristics, RIP is rarely used in modern production networks but serves as an excellent learning tool in a **beginner guide** to **Linux networking** and routing concepts.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **View routing table**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ip route show
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

2. **Check default gateway**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ip route | grep default
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

3. **Trace route to server**: Try this command
   ```bash
   traceroute 8.8.8.8` (if available) or use `tracepath
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

4. **View network interfaces**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ip link show
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```
