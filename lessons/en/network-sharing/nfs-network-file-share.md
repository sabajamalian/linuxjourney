## Lesson Content

The most standard protocol for network file sharing in Linux is NFS, which stands for **Network File System**. NFS allows a server to share its directories and files with one or more client machines over a network, making them appear as if they were local resources.

This lesson will focus on the configuration of an **NFS client**, as setting up an NFS server can be a more complex process.

### Mounting an NFS Share

To connect to an NFS share, you first need to ensure the NFS client service is running. Then, you can use the `mount` command to attach the remote directory to a local mount point on your system.

```bash
sudo service nfsclient start
sudo mount server:/directory /mount_directory
```

In this example, `server:/directory` is the remote share you want to access, and `/mount_directory` is the local directory where the share will be mounted.

### Using Automount for NFS

If you frequently access an NFS share, you might consider making the mount permanent. While adding an entry to the `/etc/fstab` file is a common method for local drives, it can cause significant boot delays or even failures if the network connection or NFS server is unavailable during startup.

A better solution for network shares is **automount**. This service, managed by the `automount` tool or its modern implementation `amd`, dynamically mounts a filesystem on-demand. When a file or directory within a specified path is accessed, automount automatically connects to the remote server and mounts the share. This ensures seamless access when needed without impacting the system's boot process.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **Check SSH availability**: Try this command
   ```bash
   which ssh
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

2. **Test local connection**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ss -tuln | grep :22
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

3. **View network shares**: Try this command
   ```bash
   mount | grep nfs` or similar
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

4. **Check rsync**: Try this command
   ```bash
   which rsync` and `rsync --version
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```
