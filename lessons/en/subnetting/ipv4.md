## Lesson Content

Every device on a network has a unique identifier called an IP (Internet Protocol) address. This lesson, a key part of our `complete linux tutorial`, focuses on IPv4 addresses—the most common type you'll encounter. For any `beginner linux` user, understanding IPv4 is a critical first step into the world of networking.

### Why IPv4 is Essential

Learning about IPv4 is fundamental for anyone serious about system administration or network management. It forms the backbone of most network communication. This guide offers the `best way to learn linux` networking from the ground up. While this isn't one of those `free linux certification courses`, mastering these basics is a key step toward professional certification.

### IPv4 Address Structure

An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number, but it's usually shown in a human-readable format like this:

```
204.23.124.23
```

This address has two main parts: the **network portion**, which identifies the network, and the **host portion**, which identifies the specific device on that network. The address is divided into four sections separated by periods, with each section called an **octet**. An octet is a group of 8 bits, meaning an IPv4 address is 4 bytes (32 bits) long. Understanding this structure is crucial for network configuration and troubleshooting.

### Finding Your IP Address

One of the first tasks for any Linux user is to find their system's IP address. You can do this using simple command-line tools. The traditional command for this is `ifconfig`. While it is still found on many systems, it is considered a legacy tool.

```bash
pete@icebox:~$ ifconfig -a
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 1d:3a:32:24:4d:ce
          inet addr:192.168.1.129  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fd60::21c:29ff:fe63:5cdc/64 Scope:Link
```

In the output above, the IPv4 address is `192.168.1.129`.

### Using the ip addr Command

The modern and recommended method uses the `ip` command. The `ip addr` command has replaced `ifconfig` and is the standard on most current Linux distributions. It provides more detailed information and is the tool you should focus on learning.

```bash
pete@icebox:~$ ip addr show
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 1d:3a:32:24:4d:ce brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.129/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic eth0
       valid_lft 85646sec preferred_lft 85646sec
```

Here, you can find the same IPv4 address, `192.168.1.129`, listed next to `inet` for the `eth0` interface.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **View IP address**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ip addr show | grep inet
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

2. **Calculate subnet: Use `ipcalc 192.168.1.0/24` (if available)**
   ```bash
   # Follow the instructions from the lesson
   ```

3. **Check network mask**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep netmask` or `ip addr
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

4. **View CIDR notation**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ip addr show | grep inet
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```
