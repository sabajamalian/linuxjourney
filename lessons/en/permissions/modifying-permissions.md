## Lesson Content

When you need to modify file or directory access rights, the primary tool you'll use is the `chmod` (change mode) command. Understanding **how to change permissions in Linux** is a fundamental skill for any user. The `chmod` command offers two main methods for this task: symbolic and numerical mode.

### Using Symbolic Mode

Symbolic mode is often considered more readable because it uses letters to represent users and permissions. You first specify which permission set you want to change (user, group, or other), then use a `+` to add a permission or a `-` to remove it.

- `u` (user/owner)
- `g` (group)
- `o` (others)
- `a` (all: user, group, and others)

Let's see **how to change file permissions linux** style with some examples.

To add the execute permission for the user on a file, you would use:

```bash
chmod u+x myfile
```

This command adds (`+`) the executable (`x`) permission for the user (`u`) on `myfile`.

To remove a permission, you use the `-` operator. For instance, to remove the write permission for the group:

```bash
chmod g-w myfile
```

You can also modify multiple permissions at once. The following command adds write permission for both the user and the group:

```bash
chmod ug+w myfile
```

### Using Numerical (Octal) Mode

Another powerful way to **change permission linux** offers is through numerical, or octal, mode. This method allows you to set all permissions for the user, group, and others simultaneously with a three-digit number.

The permissions are represented by the following values:

- `4`: read (r)
- `2`: write (w)
- `1`: execute (x)

To set a permission set, you add the numbers together. For example, to grant read, write, and execute permissions, you would use `4 + 2 + 1 = 7`.

Let's look at a common example:

```bash
chmod 755 myfile
```

How does this `linux change permission` command work? Let's break down the number `755`:

- **7 (User):** `4 + 2 + 1` -> The user gets read, write, and execute permissions (`rwx`).
- **5 (Group):** `4 + 0 + 1` -> The group gets read and execute permissions (`r-x`).
- **5 (Others):** `4 + 0 + 1` -> All other users get read and execute permissions (`r-x`).

### Security Considerations

While `chmod` is essential, it's crucial to use it carefully. Changing permissions without understanding the implications can expose sensitive files to unauthorized modification or viewing. For example, recursively setting `777` permissions (`chmod -R 777 /some/directory`) is a common but dangerous practice that gives everyone full read, write, and execute access. Always apply the principle of least privilege, granting only the permissions that are strictly necessary.
