## Lesson Content

Imagine you are at a large concert. To get from the general audience area to the exclusive backstage, you can't just walk through. You need a special pass that grants you access through a specific, guarded door. In the world of computing, **system calls** are those special passes.

### What Are System Calls?

System calls, often abbreviated as syscalls, provide a way for user-space processes to request services directly from the kernel. The kernel exposes a set of services through the system call API. These services are essential for operations like reading or writing to a file, managing memory, or handling network connections. The number of available system calls is fixed; you cannot add new ones arbitrarily. Your system maintains a `syscall table` where each system call is registered with a unique ID.

### The System Call Mechanism in Linux

When you run a program like `ls`, the code within it doesn't execute the **system call linux** command directly. Instead, it uses a library function, which acts as a wrapper. This wrapper function sets up the necessary parameters and then triggers a software interrupt, or a "trap."

This trap signals the processor to switch from the non-privileged user mode to the privileged kernel mode. Once in kernel mode, a system call handler takes over. It uses the unique ID to look up the requested function in the `syscall table` and then executes it. For example, the `stat()` system call, used to query a file's status, is found and run this way. After the kernel completes the task, it switches the context back to user mode and returns a status code to your process, indicating success or an error.

### Viewing System Calls with strace

You can observe the system calls a process makes in real-time using the `strace` command. This tool is incredibly useful for debugging and understanding how a program interacts with the kernel.

To see the system calls made by the `ls` command, you would run:

```bash
strace ls
```

This will output a detailed list of every system call `ls` performs during its execution.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **Check kernel version**: Try this command
   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

2. **View kernel parameters**: Try this command
   ```bash
   sysctl -a | head -20
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

3. **List loaded modules**: Try this command
   ```bash
   lsmod | head -10
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

4. **View kernel messages**: Try this command
   ```bash
   dmesg | tail -20
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```
