## Lesson Content

System and application log files generate a lot of data, which is stored on your hard disks. Over time, these files can grow to an unmanageable size, creating several challenges for system administrators. This lesson in our Linux tutorial provides a beginner's guide to effective log management.

### The Challenge of Growing Logs

As log files expand, they consume valuable disk space. If left unchecked, they can fill up a partition, potentially causing system instability or application failures. Furthermore, searching through a single, massive log file for specific information is slow and inefficient. We need a strategy to manage these logs, keeping recent data accessible while archiving or discarding older entries.

### What is Log Rotation?

The solution to this problem is a process called **log rotation**. The most common utility for this task on Linux systems is `logrotate`. This tool automates the process of managing log files. Log rotation typically involves:

- Renaming the current log file (e.g., `app.log` becomes `app.log.1`).
- Creating a new, empty log file for new entries.
- Compressing older log files to save disk space (e.g., `app.log.1.gz`).
- Deleting the oldest log files after a certain number of rotations.

This automated log management ensures that logs remain a manageable size and that disk space is used efficiently.

### How logrotate Works

The `logrotate` utility is highly configurable and is typically scheduled to run automatically once a day via a cron job. Its main configuration file is `/etc/logrotate.conf`, but individual application log settings are usually placed in separate files within the `/etc/logrotate.d/` directory. These configuration files allow you to specify rules for different **Linux logs**, such as how often to rotate them, how many old logs to keep, and whether to compress them. While other tools exist, `logrotate` is the standard for log rotation in the Linux world.

## Exercise
