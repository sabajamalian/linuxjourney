## Lesson Content

Effective system administration requires keeping a close eye on resource usage, and **memory monitoring** is a critical part of this process. When a system runs low on memory, its performance can degrade significantly. Linux provides several tools to help you track memory consumption, and one of the most versatile is `vmstat`.

### Introduction to vmstat

The `vmstat` (virtual memory statistics) command is a powerful **memory utilization monitor** that reports information about processes, memory, paging, block I/O, traps, and CPU activity. Running it without any arguments provides a snapshot of the system's current state since the last boot.

```bash
pete@icebox:~$ vmstat
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 1  0      0 396528  38816 384036    0    0     4     2   38   79  0  0 99  0  0
```

The output is organized into several columns. Let's break down what each field means.

### Procs

- `r`: The number of runnable processes waiting for run time.
- `b`: The number of processes in uninterruptible sleep, typically waiting for I/O.

### Memory

- `swpd`: The amount of virtual memory used (in kilobytes).
- `free`: The amount of idle memory (in kilobytes).
- `buff`: The amount of memory used as buffers.
- `cache`: The amount of memory used as a page cache.

### Swap

- `si`: The amount of memory swapped in from disk per second (in kilobytes). High values indicate the system is low on physical memory.
- `so`: The amount of memory swapped out to disk per second (in kilobytes). This should ideally be zero.

### IO

- `bi`: Blocks received from a block device (blocks/s).
- `bo`: Blocks sent to a block device (blocks/s).

### System

- `in`: The number of interrupts per second, including the clock.
- `cs`: The number of context switches per second.

### CPU

These are percentages of total CPU time.

- `us`: Time spent running non-kernel code (user time).
- `sy`: Time spent running kernel code (system time).
- `id`: Time spent idle.
- `wa`: Time spent waiting for I/O.
- `st`: Time stolen from a virtual machine (for virtualized environments).

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **View top processes**: Try this command
   ```bash
   top -b -n 1 | head -20
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

2. **Check memory usage**: Try this command
   ```bash
   free -h
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

3. **View CPU info**: Try this command
   ```bash
   cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'model name' | head -1
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

4. **Check load average**: Try this command
   ```bash
   uptime
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```
