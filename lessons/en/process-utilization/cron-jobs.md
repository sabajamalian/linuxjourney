## Lesson Content

While process utilization is important, it's also a great time to introduce a powerful tool for `Linux automation`: the `cron` daemon. This background service allows you to `schedule tasks` to run automatically at specific times or intervals. These scheduled tasks are commonly known as `cron jobs`. This is incredibly useful for automating routine actions, such as running a backup script every night or cleaning up temporary files once a week.

### What are Cron Jobs

Imagine you have a script at `/home/pete/scripts/change_wallpaper` that you run every morning to set a new desktop background. Instead of running it manually each day, you can create a `cron job` to execute it for you. By defining a schedule, you can tell the `cron` service exactly when to run your script, making it a true "set it and forget it" solution.

### Understanding Crontab Syntax

To create a `cron job`, you need to specify the schedule and the command to run. The schedule is defined by five fields, followed by the command.

```plaintext
30 08 * * * /home/pete/scripts/change_wallpaper
```

The five time-and-date fields are, from left to right:

- **Minute:** 0-59
- **Hour:** 0-23 (in 24-hour format)
- **Day of the month:** 1-31
- **Month:** 1-12
- **Day of the week:** 0-7 (where both 0 and 7 represent Sunday)

An asterisk (`*`) in a field acts as a wildcard, meaning "every". In the example above, the schedule `30 08 * * *` tells `cron` to run the command at 8:30 AM, every day of the month, every month, and every day of the week.

### Managing Cron Jobs with Crontab

You manage your personal `cron jobs` using the `crontab` command, which allows you to edit your user-specific crontab file. This file holds all the `cron jobs` you have scheduled.

To add or edit your `cron jobs`, use the `-e` (edit) flag. This will open your crontab file in your default text editor.

```bash
crontab -e
```

Once you add your job definition and save the file, `cron` will automatically read the new schedule. You can also list your active `cron jobs` with `crontab -l` or remove all of them with `crontab -r`. Using `cron jobs` is a fundamental skill for anyone interested in `Linux automation`.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **View top processes**: Try this command
   ```bash
   top -b -n 1 | head -20
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

2. **Check memory usage**: Try this command
   ```bash
   free -h
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

3. **View CPU info**: Try this command
   ```bash
   cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'model name' | head -1
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

4. **Check load average**: Try this command
   ```bash
   uptime
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```
