## Lesson Content

In Linux, when you want to automatically mount filesystems at startup, you configure them in a special configuration file located at `/etc/fstab`. The name `fstab` is short for "filesystem table," and this file contains a permanent list of filesystems that the system should mount during the boot process. Understanding the **fstab linux** configuration is a key skill for any system administrator.

### What is /etc/fstab

The `/etc/fstab` file is a system configuration file that defines all available disk partitions and other types of filesystems and data sources that are not necessarily disk-based. The system consults this file during startup to determine which filesystems to mount automatically.

Here is an example of a typical **fstab file**:

```plaintext
pete@icebox:~$ cat /etc/fstab
UUID=130b882f-7d79-436d-a096-1e594c92bb76 /               ext4    relatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1
UUID=78d203a0-7c18-49bd-9e07-54f44cdb5726 /home           xfs     relatime        0       2
UUID=22c3d34b-467e-467c-b44d-f03803c2c526 none            swap    sw              0       0
```

### The fstab File Structure

Each line in the **etc fstab** file represents one filesystem and contains six fields separated by spaces or tabs. Let's break down what each field means:

- **Device Identifier**: This specifies the device to mount. Modern systems use a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to avoid issues if the device name (e.g., `/dev/sda1`) changes.
- **Mount Point**: The directory in the filesystem where the device will be mounted (e.g., `/` or `/home`).
- **Filesystem Type**: The type of filesystem on the device, such as `ext4`, `xfs`, `btrfs`, or `swap`.
- **Options**: Mount options that control how the filesystem is mounted. Common options include `defaults`, `relatime`, and `errors=remount-ro`. For a full list, consult the `mount` manpage.
- **Dump**: This field is used by the `dump` utility to determine if a filesystem needs to be backed up. A value of `0` means it will be ignored, which is a safe default.
- **Pass**: This field is used by `fsck` to determine the order for checking filesystems at boot time. The root filesystem (`/`) should be `1`, other filesystems should be `2`, and a value of `0` means the filesystem will not be checked.

### How to Edit /etc/fstab

You can add an entry by directly modifying the `/etc/fstab` file using a text editor with root privileges. Be extremely careful when editing this file; an incorrect entry in the **fstab** can prevent your system from booting correctly. It is always a good practice to back up the file before making changes. After saving your changes, you can test them without rebooting by running the command `sudo mount -a`, which mounts all filesystems listed in `/etc/fstab`.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **Check disk usage**: Try this command
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

2. **View directory usage**: Try this command
   ```bash
   du -sh /home
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

3. **Check filesystem type**: Try this command
   ```bash
   df -T
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

4. **View mounted filesystems**: Try this command
   ```bash
   mount | column -t
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```
