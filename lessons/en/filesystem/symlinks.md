## Lesson Content

When you list files in detail, you see a lot of information. Let's look at a previous example of inode information from the `ls -li` command:

```plaintext
pete@icebox:~$ ls -li
140 drwxr-xr-x 2 pete pete 6 Jan 20 20:13 Desktop
141 drwxr-xr-x 2 pete pete 6 Jan 20 20:01 Documents
```

We've previously glossed over the third field in this output. This field is the link count.

### The Link Count in Linux

The **link count in linux** is the total number of hard links a file has. To understand what this means, we first need to discuss what links are. In Linux, there are two types of links: symbolic links (symlinks) and hard links.

### Understanding Symlinks

In the Windows operating system, you have shortcuts, which are essentially aliases that point to other files. In Linux, the equivalent is a symbolic link, also known as a soft link or **symlink**. A symlink is a special type of file that points to another file or directory by its name.

Let's see this in practice. We'll create a few files and then a symlink.

```bash
pete@icebox:~/Desktop$ echo 'myfile' > myfile
pete@icebox:~/Desktop$ echo 'myfile2' > myfile2
pete@icebox:~/Desktop$ echo 'myfile3' > myfile3

pete@icebox:~/Desktop$ ln -s myfile myfilelink
pete@icebox:~/Desktop$ ls -li
total 12
  151 -rw-rw-r-- 1 pete pete 7 Jan 21 21:36 myfile
93401 -rw-rw-r-- 1 pete pete 8 Jan 21 21:36 myfile2
93402 -rw-rw-r-- 1 pete pete 8 Jan 21 21:36 myfile3
93403 lrwxrwxrwx 1 pete pete 6 Jan 21 21:39 myfilelink -> myfile
```

Here, we've created a symbolic link named `myfilelink` that points to `myfile`. When you use `ls` to view an `ls symlink`, it's clearly identified by the `l` at the beginning of the permissions string and the `->` symbol pointing to the target. Notice that the symlink has its own unique inode number (93403). Because symlinks point to filenames rather than inodes, they can span across different filesystems.

### Understanding Hard Links

The other type of link is a hard link. A hard link creates another file entry that points directly to the same inode as the original file.

Let's create a hard link for `myfile2`:

```bash
pete@icebox:~/Desktop$ ln myfile2 myhardlink
pete@icebox:~/Desktop$ ls -li
total 16
  151 -rw-rw-r-- 1 pete pete 7 Jan 21 21:36 myfile
93401 -rw-rw-r-- 2 pete pete 8 Jan 21 21:36 myfile2
93402 -rw-rw-r-- 1 pete pete 8 Jan 21 21:36 myfile3
93403 lrwxrwxrwx 1 pete pete 6 Jan 21 21:39 myfilelink -> myfile
93401 -rw-rw-r-- 2 pete pete 8 Jan 21 21:36 myhardlink
```

Notice that `myhardlink` shares the exact same inode number (93401) as `myfile2`. The link count for both files has also increased to 2. This is because two file entries now point to the same inode. If you modify the contents of `myfile2`, the changes will be reflected in `myhardlink`, and vice versa. If you delete `myfile2`, the file's data will still be accessible through `myhardlink`. The inode and its data are only removed from the disk when the link count drops to zero. Because hard links point to inodes, which are unique within a single filesystem, they cannot span across different filesystems.

### Creating Symlinks and Hard Links

You can create both types of links using the `ln` command. The syntax is straightforward.

To create a symbolic link, use the `-s` flag:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/link
```

To create a hard link, omit the `-s` flag:

```bash
ln /path/to/original /path/to/link
```

Using `ls symlinks` or general `ls links` commands with the `-l` option is essential for managing and identifying these different file types.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **Check disk usage**: Try this command
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

2. **View directory usage**: Try this command
   ```bash
   du -sh /home
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

3. **Check filesystem type**: Try this command
   ```bash
   df -T
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

4. **View mounted filesystems**: Try this command
   ```bash
   mount | column -t
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

## Quiz Question

What is the command and its primary option used to create a symlink? Your answer must be in English and is case-sensitive. Please include the space between the command and the option.
