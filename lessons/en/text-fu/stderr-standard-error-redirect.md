## Lesson Content

Let's explore what happens when a command produces an error. Try to list the contents of a directory that doesn't exist and redirect the output to a file named `peanuts.txt`.

```bash
ls /fake/directory > peanuts.txt
```

Instead of a clean prompt, you will see an error message on your screen:

```plaintext
ls: cannot access /fake/directory: No such file or directory
```

You might be wondering why this message wasn't sent to the file. This is because another I/O stream is at play: **standard error**, or **stderr**.

### What is Standard Error in Linux?

In Linux, `stderr` is a default output stream used by programs to send error messages and diagnostics. It is completely separate from the standard output (`stdout`) stream, which is used for normal program output. By default, both `stdout` and `stderr` send their output to your terminal screen, which is why you see the error message directly.

To control `stderr`, you need a different redirection method.

### Understanding File Descriptors

To manage I/O streams like `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`, the system uses file descriptors. A **file descriptor** is a non-negative number that the kernel uses to identify an open file or stream. The default file descriptors are:

- `0`: stdin (standard input)
- `1`: stdout (standard output)
- `2`: stderr (standard error)

The number `2` is the dedicated **stderr file descriptor**, and we can use it to control where error messages go.

### Redirecting stderr to a File

To redirect `stderr` to a file, you use the file descriptor `2` followed by the `>` operator. This command will send any error messages into the specified `stderr file`.

```bash
ls /fake/directory 2> peanuts.txt
```

Now, your terminal will be quiet, and the error message will be inside `peanuts.txt`.

### Combining stdout and stderr

What if you want to capture both normal output and error messages in the same file? You can achieve this by redirecting both streams.

```bash
ls /fake/directory /etc/passwd > peanuts.txt 2>&1
```

Let's break this down:

1. `> peanuts.txt` redirects `stdout` (file descriptor 1) to the `peanuts.txt` file.
2. `2>&1` redirects `stderr` (file descriptor 2) to the same location that `stdout` (file descriptor 1) is currently pointing to.

The order is important. `2>&1` sends `stderr` to the current destination of `stdout`. In this case, `stdout` is pointing to a file, so `stderr` is also sent to that file.

A more modern and shorter way to redirect both `stdout` and `stderr` is by using `&>`.

```bash
ls /fake/directory /etc/passwd &> peanuts.txt
```

### Discarding Error Messages

Sometimes, you might want to run a command and completely ignore any potential error messages. To do this, you can redirect `stderr` to a special file called `/dev/null`, which discards any data written to it.

```bash
ls /fake/directory 2> /dev/null
```

This command will execute, and any error output from `stderr` will be sent to `/dev/null` and discarded, leaving your screen clean.
