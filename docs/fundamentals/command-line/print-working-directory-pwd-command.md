## Lesson Content

In Linux, a core concept is that everything is treated as a file. These files are organized within a hierarchical structure known as the filesystem. Understanding this structure is key to navigating your system effectively.

### The Directory Tree in Linux

The entire filesystem starts from a single top-level directory called the root directory, represented by a forward slash (`/`). From the root, the **directory tree in linux** branches out into various subdirectories, which can contain files and further subdirectories.

Here is a simplified example of what this structure looks like:

```plaintext
/
|-- bin
|   |-- file1
|   |-- file2
|-- etc
|   |-- file3
|   `-- directory1
|       |-- file4
|       `-- file5
|-- home
|-- var
```

### Understanding File Paths

The location of any file or directory is described by its path. A path is a sequence of directories that leads from a starting point to a specific destination. For example, if you have a folder named `pete` inside the `/home` directory, and a `Movies` folder inside `pete`, the full path would be `/home/pete/Movies`.

### What is the Full Form of PWD in Linux?

When navigating the filesystem, it's essential to know your current location. The command for this is `pwd`. The **full form of pwd in linux** is "print working directory." Its sole purpose is to display the full path of the directory you are currently in, starting from the root (`/`).

### Using the linux pwd Command

To find your **current directory linux**, simply type the **linux pwd** command and press Enter. It prints the absolute path to your present location on the command line.

```bash
pwd
```

Where are you? Where am I? Give it a try to see your own current working directory.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **Check your current location**: Run pwd to see where you are in the filesystem
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   /home/your-username
   ```

2. **Navigate to the root directory**: Change to the root and verify your location
   ```bash
   cd /
   pwd
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   /
   ```

3. **Explore a system directory**: Navigate to /etc and check your working directory
   ```bash
   cd /etc
   pwd
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   /etc
   ```

4. **Return to your home directory**: Use cd without arguments and confirm the change
   ```bash
   cd
   pwd
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   /home/your-username
   ```

## Quiz Question
