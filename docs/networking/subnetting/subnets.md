## Lesson Content

How can you tell if two computers are on the same network? The answer lies in understanding the subnet, short for subnetwork. A subnet is a logical division of an IP network, grouping hosts with similar IP addresses. These hosts are typically in close physical proximity, allowing for efficient data transfer between them. Think of it like sending mail within the same postal code; it's much faster and simpler than sending it to a different state.

For a host to be part of a **linux subnet**, its IP address is divided into two parts: a network prefix and a host identifier. For example, if one host has an IP of 192.168.1.8 and another has 192.168.1.9, they likely share the same network prefix. The common part identifies the network, while the unique numbers (8 and 9) identify the individual hosts.

### Understanding the Linux Subnet Mask

A **linux subnet mask** is what determines which part of an IP address is the network portion and which part is the host portion. A typical subnet mask looks like this:

```plaintext
255.255.255.0
```

To understand this, we need to think in binary. Each number in an IP address or subnet mask is an octet, representing 8 bits. In binary, a `1` means "on" and a `0` means "off". If you convert the binary number `11111111` to decimal, you get 255. This means an octet can range from 0 (`00000000`) to 255 (`11111111`).

The `255`s in the mask "mask out" the network portion of the IP address. So, with a mask of `255.255.255.0` and an IP of `192.168.1.8`, the `192.168.1` part is the network, and `8` is the host. We often denote a **subnet linux** configuration by its network prefix followed by the subnet mask, like `192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0`.

### The Purpose of Subnetting Subnets

Why do we create subnets? The practice of **subnetting subnets** is crucial for organizing and managing networks effectively. It involves dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable segments. This offers several key benefits:

- **Improved Performance:** By segmenting a network, you reduce the volume of broadcast traffic within each subnet, leading to less congestion and better overall performance.
- **Enhanced Security:** Subnets allow you to isolate different parts of your network. A host on one subnet cannot directly interact with a host on another without a router, creating a security boundary. You can implement access rules on the router to control traffic flow between subnets.
- **Simplified Administration:** Breaking a large network into smaller logical units makes it easier to manage, troubleshoot, and apply network policies.

### Connecting Subnets

What if you need to connect to hosts on a different network, like yahoo.com? To connect different subnets, you need a device that is connected to more than one subnet: a router.

For example, a host at `192.168.1.129` on a network with a `255.255.255.0` mask can reach any other host in the `192.168.1.0` network. To reach the internet, it must send traffic through its gateway, which is the router. On many home networks, the router's address is often `.1` of the subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.1`). This router has another connection to a different subnet (like your ISP's network), enabling communication with the wider internet.

## Exercise

Follow these steps in your Ubuntu VM terminal to practice the concepts from this lesson:

1. **View IP address**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ip addr show | grep inet
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

2. **Calculate subnet: Use `ipcalc 192.168.1.0/24` (if available)**
   ```bash
   # Follow the instructions from the lesson
   ```

3. **Check network mask**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep netmask` or `ip addr
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

4. **View CIDR notation**: Try this command
   ```bash
   ip addr show | grep inet
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   (Output will vary based on your system)
   ```

## Quiz Question

A subnet is defined by a network prefix and a subnet mask. True or False? (Please answer with 'True' or 'False'. The answer is case-sensitive and must be in English.)
